Python is an intuitive and easy to learn coding language for someone who comes from a beginner coding background. As someone with very little experience coding, I really enjoyed learning Python. I found is made more sense to me than other languages like R. 
Here are some examples of the ways python is a functional and easy language to use:


```{r}
install.packages("reticulate")
``` 

If faced with a long list, python makes it very easy to select certain entries. Here is an example. 
```{python}
list1= ["a", "b","c","d"] 
list1[2]
list1 [-1]
list1 [2:]
```
This allows a user to select just the position of the entry, without necissarily knowing what the entry is. This is a lot more complicated in other languages like R.

In a given sentence, Python allows a user to count how many times each character shows up. Here is an example:
```{python}
sentence= "Python is awesome!" 
counts = {}            
for c in sentence:     
    if c in counts:    
        counts[c]+=1   
    else:
        counts[c]=1  
for c in counts:
    print(c, "appears", counts[c],"times")
```

Returning certain characters from a string is also really easy to do in Python.  

```{python}
import re

string1="I am originiall from New York City, about 1600 miles away from where I live now, Houston. I moved when I was 8 years old and my sister was 6.5 years old. Today, I go to UT Austin, a 3 hour drive from my hometown. Also, my favorite numbers are 566, 62, 90293, and 12"

re.findall(r"[0-9]+",string1)
```
